\chapter{Introduction}

Almost everyone uses the internet everyday, whether connecting to the internet from their mobile devices or browsing the internet on their personal computers. It is safe to say that most of us will struggle with everyday activities without devices that are capable to connect to the internet. For example, getting a taxi ride, ordering food delivery or even navigating to places we want to go. Apple have made an interesting short movie "predicting" what might happen without Apps on mobile devices during their annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in 2017 [15].
 
Internet have an even greater presents and role within the science and engineering community, sites like Google Scholar and The New England Journal of Medicine have benefited scientists, doctors and engineers greatly [15] [16] [17]. Prior to the wide adaption of the internet, searchers, scholars and students would spend countless hours in physical libraries, browsing through hundreds of thousands of academic journals and books in order to answer one question or to solidify a proposal they had in mind. Today with the help of the internet, it will hardly take a few minutes. This leads to the jump in research productivity which helps researchers and engineers to produce their research and production output to a new level, thus allowing them to essentially do more things with the same amount of time.

\textbf{{\Large Chapter 1.1 What is JavaScript and the history of the web}}

\bigskip

For the last 20 years, JavaScript is the technology that dominates the majority of web browsers and web development. Although updates and new versions are issued regularly, they are still becoming more aged everyday, and software engineers have been finding ways to improve the performance, user experience and developer experience for this ageing technology. For example, Microsoft developed the Typescript language to combat the "strange" nature of the JavaScript language [18], and to help resolving the lack of type checking within JavaScript [19]. Facebook developed the "React" library framework to improve developer experience by introducing the "component" concept. Where each class or function within a React project can be seen as a UI (user interface) component. This can be a button, a table or a component with more complexity, such as a navigation header component [20]. As expected and intended, some of the popular web development frameworks and libraries such as React JS and Angular developed by Google have gained significant attention and much of the industry-wide adaption since their release and they have indeed significantly improved browsing experience for all of us.

There is a wide spread misconception that Al Gore, the Former Vice President of the United States, invented the internet. However, this is not true as Al Gore has never claimed or said so. Instead, what he actually said was "I took the \textbf{initiative} in creating the internet" during his interview with CNN in 1999 [22]. However, AL Gore did introduced the High Performance Computing Act of 1991 [23], which help funded the creation of the first mainstream web browser Mosaic [24], as well as the creation of the high-speed fiber optic computer network [25].

JavaScript was born not long after the release of the first version of Netscape Navigator - the most popular web browser in the late 90s. It was written by Brendan Eich and it only took him 10 days to release the first version [26]. Initially, JavaScript did not gain that much attention and it wasn't until the release of Internet Explorer version 3 which added the support for the language which then popularised it to the general public [27] [28]. Growing up alongside the internet, JavaScript have had quite a number of iterations and feature upgrades. Although it is indeed powerful and popular, however, in recent years, developers and engineers started to see JavaScript as a "messy" language [figure \ref{fig:javascript_meme}]. During this period, another popular web technology - Adobe flash player, was gradually being replaced by it's newer counterpart - HTML 5 largely due to it's performance and security issues [30]. Between 2011 and 2021, the percentage of websites using Flash dropped from 28.5 percent to just 2.2 percent. Adobe alongside popular web browsers formally ended the support and update for Flash in 2021 [32].

A major change was just around the corner.

Developers and major tech companies started forming the future for the web. They wanted a new technology standard that aligned with the the current web application development trend as well as laying the groundwork for the future of the industry. After much discussion, they came up with the idea of creating a brand new language based on all the experience and mistakes from the last 20 years. Therefore, in 2017, we were introduced to the WebAssembly language.

\textbf{{\Large Chapter 1.2 Meet WebAssembly}}

\bigskip

After the initial release in 2017, WebAssembly was first adapted by a number of major web browsers [21]. Since then, there has been a growing community built around the technology as more and more projects started using WebAssembly. As mentioned above, JavaScript have been the de facto language for web browsers since the beginning of the web. However, this was never the original intention during the development of JavaScript.

WebAssembly is the first widely adopted language that was built entire from the ground up with a formal semantics, and it was designed to work in areas it originally intended, which is large, complex apps running on modern web browsers. WebAssembly have an incredibly clean, simple yet powerful design such as memory allocation and garbage collection [21]. However, WebAssembly is actually a form of binary code. Developers and engineers don't usually write WASM code directly, instead they write programs with other low-level languages such as c, c++ or rust [29].

One of the biggest advantage for WebAssembly is standardisation. That is, the ability to compile a wide variety of different programming languages down to just one, which can be very useful in a number of different scenarios and is largely missing from today's software development practices. As an example, Java and Python developers cannot work on the same piece of software together as the code compilation method is very different between the two languages. However, when it comes to developing WebAssembly programs, developers from all programming backgrounds now have the ability to work together and contribute to the same piece of software using languages they are comfortable with. A good example
