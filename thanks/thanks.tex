\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I want to express my sincere gratitude to my research advisors: \textbf{Dr Joseph Davis} and \textbf{Dr Kanchana Thilakarathna} for their continuous support for my Honours study and research and spending so much of their personal time to offer guidance and discussion. They also helped guide me to this incredible area of research. This is still a very new research topic, and I am very fortunate to have the opportunity to work on this topic and help contribute to the field. I am very excited to see what the future of web technology holds.

I would also like to thank my close friends, both in \textbf{Australia} and \textbf{New Zealand}, for their motivation and support and for keeping me sane during this process. Finally, a big thanks to my parents for providing me with love and care throughout my life and my academic journey.
