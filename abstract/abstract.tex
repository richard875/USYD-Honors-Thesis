\chapter*{Abstract}

Since the creation of the first computer back in 1943 [1], to the widely adoption of the internet that lead to the "dot com bubble" in the late 90s [2], all the way to today where everyone and everything are connected. It is hard to believe we used to live in a time without any of these. It is even harder to imagine what our life will be like without all the technologies and devices around us. The humanity have truly came a long way since these days.

Many of us have been around since the early days of the internet, growing up during the age of AOL dial up services and browsing the internet at the maximum speed of 56 kilobit per second.
